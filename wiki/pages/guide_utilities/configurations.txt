====== Configuration File Postprocessing ======

For the postprocessing of IMD configuration files, IMD contains a group of utility programs with a common usage model:

|[[#imd_angle|imd_angle]]    |compute angular distribution function       |
|[[#imd_cna|imd_cna]]        |perform Common-Neighbour Analysis           |
|[[#imd_conn|imd_conn]]      |compute connection matrix                   |
|[[#imd_coord|imd_coord]]    |compute coordination numbers                |
|[[#imd_elco|imd_elco]]      |compute elastic moduli                      |
|[[#imd_pair|imd_pair]]      |compute pair distribution function          |
|[[#imd_ps|imd_ps]]          |create PostScript picture                   |
|[[#imd_ring|imd_ring]]      |compute ring statistics                     |
|[[#imd_strain|imd_strain]]  |compute strain tensor from displacements    |
|[[#imd_stress|imd_stress]]  |compute stress tensor from IMD stress output|
|[[#imd_torsion|imd_torsion]]|compute torsion angle distribution function |

These programs are compiled as follows:

<code>
   gmake imd_utility[_option][_2d]
</code>
where ''%%utility%%'' is the name of the program. Some programs support further options which can be appended to the compilation target with the component ''%%_option%%''. By default, a program for 3d is compiled. Most programs support 2d versions which can be compiled using the additional component ''%%_2d%%'' in the compilation target.

The programs are run by giving the program name and one or more command line options. The following options are supported by **all** utility programs.

^Option^Values                ^Default^Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   ^
|**-p**|''%%parameter_file%%''|-      |Specifies the IMD parameter file. This option is **mandatory**.                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
|**-r**|integer >= 0          |-      |Specifies the restart parameter. The corresponding checkpoint file is chosen as input file and also the iteration file is read in. If this parameter is not present, the file specified by the IMD paramter ''%%coordname%%'' is taken as input file.                         |
|**-A**|integer >= 0          |-      |The corresponding avpos outfile is chosen as input file and also the avpos iteration file is read in.                                                                                                                                                                         |
|**-v**|-                     |-      |All virtual types are treated as being different. In this case, the number of types ''%%N%%'' is ''%%vtypes-1%%''. If this option is not used, all atom types are taken modulo ''%%ntypes%%'', the number of different real atom types, and ''%%N%%'' equals ''%%ntypes-1%%''.|

Most of the programs produce output files. The name of these output files are the names of the input files with program specific suffixes. If checkpoint files are used as input files, the suffix ''%%.chkpt%%'' is omitted.

===== imd_angle =====

Computes angular distribution histograms of IMD configurations.

The following special options can be used:

^Option^Values     ^Default^Description                                                                           ^
|**-n**|integer > 0|1000   |Specifies the number of slots in the angular distribution histogram.                  |
|**-e**|real > 0.0 |1.0    |Specifies the maximal radius for which angles between neighbouring atoms are computed.|
|**-a**|real >= 0.0|0.0    |Specifies the minimal radius for which angles between neighbouring atoms are computed.|

The output file name of **imd_angle** has the suffix ''%%.angle%%''. For every slot in the histogram, one line is written:

<code>
    phi g_000 g_001 ... g_00N g_011 ... g_01N ... g_0NN g_100 ... g_NNN
</code>
The first entry ''%%phi%%'' is the angle with range [0,180], and the remaining entries are the histogram values for the different combinations of atom types. The histogram entry ''%%g_ijk%%'' is the normalized number of times the angle ''%%phi%%'' occurs between the atoms of type ''%%i%%'', ''%%j%%'', and ''%%k%%'' where the angle is centered at ''%%i%%''. ''%%g_ijk%%'' is normalized with respect to the total number of angles computed. In the case of 2 types of particles, for example, the histogram has the following format:

<code>
    phi g_000 g_001 g_011 g_100 g_101 g_111
</code>
===== imd_cna =====

Performs the Common-Neighbour Analysis (CNA) for IMD configuration files.

The CNA classifies pairs of atoms according to their local environment. (J.D.Honeycutt and H.C.Andersen, //J.Phys.Chem.// **91** (1987) 4950, A.S.Clarke and H.Jónsson, //Phys.Rev.// **E47** (1993) 3975)

A set of four indices //ijkl// (pair type) is used to characterize a pair of atoms having common nearest neighbour atoms where nearest neighbour atoms are defined by a cutoff distance. The indices have the following meaning:

|//i//|1 if the atom pair consists of nearest neighbour atoms\\\\ 2 otherwise                                     |
|//j//|number of common nearest neighbour atoms                                                                   |
|//k//|number of bonds between the common nearest neighbour atoms where bonded atoms are nearest neighbour atoms  |
|//l//|number of bonds in the longest continuous chain formed by the //k// bonds between common nearest neighbours|

The cutoff distance can be given for all pairs of atom types by the parameter ''%%r_cut%%'' in the parameter file. Alternatively, a common cutoff distance for all types can be specified by the option **-e**.

**imd_cna** gives a list of the found pair types along with their occurrences to standard output in the following form:

<code>
  pair type   occurrence     relative occurrence
--------------------------------------------------------
   ijkl        n_ijkl              t_ijkl
   ...          ...                 ...
   ...          ...                 ...
</code>
where ''%%n_ijkl%%'' is the number of times the pair type ''%%ijkl%%'' occurs and ''%%t_ijkl%%'' is ''%%n_ijkl%%'' divided by the total number of pairs.

The following special options can be used:

^Option^Values                ^Default                 ^Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           ^

|**-n**|integer > 0|10     |Specifies the maximal number of neigbours.|

===== imd_coord =====

Computes coordination numbers of IMD configurations. **imd_coord** needs the specification of cutoff radii for the atom types. If the component **_tersoff** is used in the compilation target, the cutoff radii for the Tersoff potential are taken from the parameter file and the coordination numbers are computed slightly differently (see below).

**imd_coord** writes two tables to standard output. The first table contains the relative occurrences ''%%c_ij%%'' of bonds between atoms of type //i// and //j//. It has the following format:

<code>
 Bond  Occurrence

   00    c_00
   01    c_01
   
      ...

   0N    c_0N
   10    c_10

      ...

   NN    c_NN
</code>
The second table contains the occurrences ''%%occ_i%%'' in percent of the coordination number ''%%i%%'' up to the coordination number ''%%cmax%%''. It has the format

<code>
 Coordination  Occurrence

      0          occ_0
      1          occ_1

           ...

     cmax        occ_cmax
</code>
The following special options can be used:

===== imd_elco =====

Computes the stress tensor, the tensor of the elastic moduli, and the pressure derivative of the bulk modulus of IMD configurations using the interatomic potentials.

The following potentials are currently supported:

  * Tabulated pair potentials. This is the default.
  * EAM potentials. In this case, the component **_eam** has to be used in the compilation target.
  * Many-body potentials. If the components **_tersoff**, **_stiweb**, or **_keating** are used in the compilation target, the Tersoff, the Stillinger-Weber, or the Keating potential are used, respectively. Many-body potentials only work in 3d.

By default, **imd_elco** computes the global stress tensor ''%%sigma_ij%%'', the global tensor of the elastic moduli ''%%C_ab%%'', and the global pressure derivative of the bulk modulus ''%%B'%%''. These values are written to standard output along with the atom number ''%%N%%'' , the total volume ''%%V%%'', the volume per atom ''%%v%%'', the potential energy ''%%E%%'', the total bulk modulus ''%%B%%'' and the pressure ''%%p%%''.

**imd_elco** assumes that eV and Å are used as units of energy and length. The output data are written in these units and GPa for convenience. If other units are used, the units eV and Å should be ignored.

The following special options can be used:

===== imd_pair =====

Computes radial distribution histograms of IMD configurations.

The following special options can be used:

^Option^Values     ^Default^Description                                                      ^
|**-n**|integer > 0|1000   |Specifies the number of slots in the pair distribution histogram.|
|**-a**|real >= 0.0|0.0    |Specifies the minimal radius in the histogram.                   |
|**-e**|real > 0.0 |5.0    |Specifies the maximal radius in the histogram.                   |

For every slot in the histogram, one line is written:

<code>
    r d_00 d_01 ... d_0N d_11 ... d_NN f_00 f_01 ... f_0N f_11 ... f_NN 
</code>
The first entry ''%%r%%'' is the radius, the remaining entries are the histogram values for the different combinations of atom types. The histogram entry ''%%d_ij%%'' is the number of times the distance ''%%r%%'' occurs between atoms of types ''%%i%%'' and ''%%j%%'', divided by the total number of atoms, and ''%%f_ij = d_ij/(4*pi*r^2)%%'' is a normalized radial distribution.

===== imd_ps =====

Creates (vector) PostScript files from IMD configurations.

**imd_ps** produces ball and stick visualizations of IMD configuration files. For the drawing of the bonds, cutoff radii for all atom types have to be given in the parameter file by the parameters ''%%r_cut%%'' or ''%%ters_r_cut%%''. Alternatively, the option **-e** can be used.

The geometrical setup of the projection (3d) is shown in the following figure.

{{:imd_ps.png|projection}}

**imd_ps** allows many optional parameters affecting the visualization (Grey background means that the option is available only in the 3d version):

Option

Default

Description

**-a**

0,1

0

Draw coordinate axes. The axes are drawn into the bounding box of the unrotated system (option **-u**) or the simulation box (option **-o**). The //x// axis is red, the //y// axis is yellow, and the //z// axis (3D only) is green.

**-b**

real, [-1,1]

-0.3

Brightness of bond colors. Positive values mean bright colors and negative values mean dark colors.

**-B**

real, >= 0.0

estimated

Radius of cylinders representing bonds in real (IMD) units. The value of **-B** must be smaller than the value of **-R**.

**-c**

real, >= 0.0

20

Boundary strip around bounding box (in pt).

**-C**

integer

1

Color of atoms. Negative numbers produce greyscales. The value 0 corresponds to white. **imd_ps** predefines 9 different colors represented by integers as follows:

|1|2|3|4|5|6|7|8|9|

The option **-C** allows positive integer values with up to 9 figures which denote the colors of atom types 0,1,2,.... The default colors correspond to the value 123456789.\\
For negative values, the encoding is similar, where 9 greyscales are available with the values

|1|2|3|4|5|6|7|8|9|

**-d**

real, [0,1]

0

Brightness of atom and bond colors with depth. 1 corresponds to black atoms and bonds in the background, 0 means the same colors for all atoms and bonds.

**-D**

integer, >=0

0

Represent types of atoms by different radii of the spheres. As in the case of the atom colors given by the parameter **-C**, the association of atom types with sphere radii is done by an integer with up to 9 figures. The encoding is given by the following table:

|1|2  |3  |4  |5  |6  |7  |8  |9|
|1|1/2|3/4|1/4|5/8|3/8|7/8|1/8|0|

The second row gives the radii of the atoms in units of the largest radius specified by the parameter **-R**. In the case of the number 9 corresponding to the radius 0, no atoms of the corresponding type are drawn and the bonds of this type are also omitted.

**-e**

real > 0.0

1.0

Specifies the maximal distance for which neighbouring atoms are taken into account in the drawing of bonds. Only works, if no cutoff length is given in the parameter file.

**-E**

integer

-

Color encoding of the potential energy as specified in the 10th column of an IMD configuration file. The value of **-E** determines the colors used in the encoding. Each figure of **-E** corresponds to a color as given in the following table:

|1|2|3|4|5|6|7|8|

The sequence of figures in ''%%E%%'' then corresponds to a path in the rgb cube which is used to color encode the potential energy from the lowest energy to the highest energy. If only one positive figure is given, a path with two colors is taken where the second color is white. Negative numbers correspond to preselected paths as follows:

===== imd_ring =====

Computes ring statistics of IMD configurations.

**imd_ring** searches all shortest closed paths in a configuration and gives a statistics. It only works with open boundary conditions.

The following special options can be used:

^Option^Values     ^Default^Description                                                                                                                                                                                                  ^
|**-e**|real > 0.0 |1.0    |Specifies the maximal distance for which neighbouring atoms are taken into account. If the component **_tersoff** is given in the compilation target, the cutoff radii of the Tersoff potential are employed.|
|**-l**|integer > 0|10     |Specifies the maximal length ''%%lmax%%'' of rings that are computed.                                                                                                                                        |
|**-n**|integer > 0|6      |Specifies the maximal number of neighbours for which memory of neighbour tables is allocated. In the case of the Tersoff potential, this value is taken from the parameter file.                             |

**imd_ring** writes a table to standard output with the following format:

<code>
     Ring length   Total occurrence  Relative occurrence
          3              n_3                p_3
      4      n_4            p_4
      
      .               .                  .
      .       .          .
      .       .          .
      
      lmax           n_lmax             p_lmax
</code>
where ''%%n_i%%'' is the number of rings of length ''%%i%%'' and ''%%p_i%%'' is ''%%n_i%%'' divided by the total number of rings up to the length ''%%lmax%%''. **imd_ring** writes the table of the relative occurrences of the ring lengths into a file with suffix ''%%.ring%%''.

===== imd_strain =====

Computes the strain tensor from the atomic displacements.

The displacements must be given in a file with the following format:

<code>
    x y (z) dx dy (dz)
</code>
where ''%%x%%'', ''%%y%%'', ''%%z%%'' are the positions of the atoms and ''%%dx%%'', ''%%dy%%'', ''%%dz%%'' are the displacements. The displacement file must have the name ''%%<outfiles>.dsp%%''. Alternatively, the displacement file can be created using the IMD option **disloc**. Then the restart parameter **-r**''%%<nn>%%'' should be given where ''%%<nn>%%'' is the number of steps corresponding to the displacement file.

The following special options can be used:

^Option^Values    ^Default     ^Description                                                                                                                                                        ^
|**-e**|real > 0.0|1.0         |Specifies the maximal distance ''%%rmax%%'' for which neighbouring atoms are taken into account in the computation of the derivatives of the displacements.        |
|**-c**|real > 0.0|''%%rmax%%''|Specifies the width of the cells in the cell decomposition used in the computation. For very large systems, it is advisable to use a value larger than ''%%rmax%%''|

The output file name of **imd_strain** is the displacement file name with the suffix ''%%.strain%%''.

The output file has the following format:

<code>
    n x y (z) e_xx e_yy (e_zz) (e_yz) (e_zx) e_xy
</code>
where n is a number (not the IMD atom number), ''%%x%%'', ''%%y%%'', ''%%z%%'' are the coordinates, and ''%%e_ij%%'' are the components of the strain tensor.

**imd_strain** only computes the strain tensor if an atom possesses more than two neighbours. Atoms with less than three neighbours are omitted from the outfile.

===== imd_stress =====

Computes the stress tensor from an IMD ''%%.press%%'' file.

IMD determines the (raw) stress tensor by evaluating the virial corresponding to the atomic forces. **imd_stress** computes the true stress tensor by dividing the raw stress tensor of each atom by the volume of the Voronoi cell of the respective atom. The raw stress tensor must be given in a file with the following format:

<code>
    x y (z) s_xx s_yy (s_zz) (s_yz) (s_zx) s_xy
</code>
where ''%%x%%'', ''%%y%%'', ''%%z%%'' are the positions of the atoms and ''%%s_ij%%'' are the components of the raw stress tensor. The stress file name must have the suffix ''%%.press%%''. Alternatively, the raw stress file can be created using the IMD option **stress** (with the parameter vector ''%%press_dim%%'' set equal to zero). Then the restart parameter **-r** ''%%<nn>%%'' should be given where ''%%<nn>%%'' is the number of steps corresponding to the stress file.

The following special option can be used:

^Option^Values    ^Default^Description                                                                                                                ^
|**-e**|real > 0.0|1.0    |Specifies the maximal distance for which neighbouring atoms are taken into account in the computation of the Voronoi cells.|

The output file name of **imd_stress** is the raw stress file name with the suffix ''%%.stress%%''.

The output file has the following format:

<code>
    x y (z) s_xx s_yy (s_zz) (s_yz) (s_zx) s_xy v
</code>
where ''%%s_ij%%'' are the components of the true stress tensor of the atom with coordinates ''%%x%%'', ''%%y%%'', ''%%z%%'' and ''%%v%%'' is the volume of the corresponding Voronoi cell.

**imd_stress** only computes the stress tensor if the Euler relation for a Voronoi cell is fullfilled. Otherwise, atoms are removed from the outfile.

===== imd_torsion =====

Computes torsion distribution histograms of IMD configurations.

The following special options can be used:

^Option^Values     ^Default^Description                                                                                   ^
|**-n**|integer > 0|1000   |Specifies the number of slots in the torsion distribution histogram.                          |
|**-e**|real > 0.0 |1.0    |Specifies the maximal radius for which torsion angles between neighbouring atoms are computed.|

The output file name of **imd_torsion** has the suffix ''%%.torsion%%''.

For every slot in the histogram, one line is written:

<code>
    phi g_0000 g_0001 ... g_000N g_0011 ... g_001N ... g_00NN g_0100 ... g_NNNN
</code>
The first entry ''%%phi%%'' is the angle with range [0,180], the remaining entries are the histogram values for the different combinations of atom types. The histogram entry ''%%g_ijkl%%'' is the normalized number of times the torsion angle ''%%phi%%'' occurs between the atoms of type ''%%i%%'', ''%%j%%'', ''%%k%%'', and ''%%l%%''.

{{:torsion.gif?300}}

''%%g_ijkl%%'' is normalized with respect to the total number of torsion angles computed. In the case of 2 types of particles, for example, the histogram has the following format:

<code>
  phi g_0000 g_0001 g_0011 g_0100 g_0101 g_0110 g_0111 g_1100 g_1101 g_1111
</code>

====== Interactions ======

IMD supports a large variety of different (mostly short range) effective potentials. Some of these potentials are defined by tabulated functions read from a [[guide_interactions:potential_files|potential file]], others are defined analytically by parameters read from the [[guide_parameter_file|parameter file]]. The potentials supported include [[guide_interactions:pair_potentials|central pair potentials]], [[guide_interactions:eam|Embedded Atom Method (EAM)]] potentials for metals, [[guide_interactions:meam|Modified EAM (MEAM)]] potentials, different [[guide_interactions:covalent|covalent potentials]], notably [[guide_interactions:covalent#Tersoff Potential|Tersoff]], Stillinger-Weber ([[guide_interactions:covalent#Stillinger-Weber Potential (analytic)|analytic]] and [[guide_interactions:covalent#Stillinger-Weber Potential (tabulated)|tabulated]]), Zhou-Wadley ([[guide_interactions:covalent#Zhou-Wadley Potential (analytic)]] and [[guide_interactions:covalent#Zhou-Wadley Potential (tabulated)|tabulated]]), and [[guide_interactions:covalent#Keating Potential|Keating]] potentials, [[guide_interactions:coulomb|Coulomb]] and [[guide_interactions:coulomb#The Shell Model|shell model]] potentials for ionic solids, and [[guide_interactions:gay-berne|Gay-Berne]] potentials for nematic liquid crystals.

Since the computation of the forces is the most time-critical part of a molecular dynamics simulation, support for each type of interaction has to be enabled explicitly by a compilation option. If no interaction type is specified, central pair potentials are assumed by default. Different interaction types can be combined with each other, by enabling more than one type of interaction. Their contributions are then just added. This is still somewhat experimental, and there are some restrictions. Here are some guidelines:

  * At most **one** of the [[guide_interactions:covalent|covalent potentials]] (including [[guide_interactions:meam|MEAM]], which is algorithmically similar) can be used at a time.
  * Central [[guide_interactions:pair_potentials|pair potentials]], [[guide_interactions:eam|EAM potentials]], and one of [[guide_interactions:covalent#Tersoff Potential|Tersoff]] or Stillinger-Weber potentials ([[guide_interactions:covalent#Stillinger-Weber Potential (analytic)|analytic]] and [[guide_interactions:covalent#Stillinger-Weber Potential (tabulated)|tabulated]]) **can be combined** with each other. The central pair potential part contained in these interactions is **shared**.
  * The option **pair** can be used to enable a (short range) [[guide_interactions:pair_potentials|pair potential]] part together with [[guide_interactions:coulomb|Coulomb]] potentials. The same option is also used to enable the harmonic potential used for the [[guide_interactions:coulomb#The Shell Model|shell model]] in combination with [[guide_interactions:coulomb|Coulomb interactions]].
  * [[guide_interactions:coulomb|Coulomb potentials]] can be combined with almost everything else, whether or not this makes sense.
  * [[guide_interactions:covalent#Keating Potential|Keating]] and [[guide_interactions:gay-berne|Gay-Berne]] potentials **cannot** be combined with anything else.
  * On vector machines, add the option "lj" for computed Lennard-Jones interactions.
